# VIPER-Dribbble-Client

This project is an example of using **VIPER** architecture with multiple modules and TDD in iOS.

The goal is to showcase VIPER architecture on an app that makes some network calls and a bit more complicated than a simple to-do app and how multiple modules can work together.

* Xcode 7.3.1 Swift 2.2
* Viper module generator used to generate modules https://github.com/teambox/viper-module-generator
